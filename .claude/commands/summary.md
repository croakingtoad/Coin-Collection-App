# summary

Create clear, actionable summaries for internal communications.

## Command

Help me create an effective summary for internal communication. I struggle with internal communications, so make this clear and actionable.

1. **Gather Context**
   - What needs to be communicated?
   - Who is the audience?
   - What action do I need from them?

2. **Structure the Summary**
   Create a summary with:
   - **TLDR** (1-2 sentences max)
   - **Key Points** (3-5 bullets)
   - **Action Items** (who does what by when)
   - **Next Steps** (clear and specific)

3. **Format Options**
   Provide the summary in multiple formats:
   - Slack message version
   - Email version
   - One-pager document

4. **Review Checklist**
   - [ ] Clear subject/purpose
   - [ ] Specific action items with owners
   - [ ] Deadlines included
   - [ ] Context provided for decisions
   - [ ] Easy to scan (uses formatting)

Remember: Clarity beats completeness. When in doubt, make it shorter.
